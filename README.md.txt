The purpose of this project is to develop a multifunction client server system.

It compares 2 files and returns their similarity as a percentage.

It also returns various information about a file such as number of lines (WAS SUPPOSED TO COULD NOT IMPLEMENT)

I was also trying to implement the JOptionPane as a novel feature but I could not get it to work properly.
